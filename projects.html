                            The water is collected in an above-ground horizontal
                            cistern that feeds a 4-inch

                    blessing of the Ministry of Natural Resour-
                    ces, agreed to the operation of a walleye 
                    hatchery in Fanshawe Conservation Area,
                    just north-east of London, Ontario. While 
                    this was a relatively short-lived initiative, it
                    was very popular withmembers and the 
                    community at large. Many would conclude
                    it was also very successful considering the
                    exciting fishery that developed closely
                    thereafter.

                    The Lake Erie Management Unit (LEMU) 
                    forced the TRAA to shut down the walleye 
                    hatchery after only three seasons of opera-
                    tion. The LEMU's decision was dubiously
                    based on an American study, that the Tha-
                    mes River walleye were genetically unique
                    from the Grand River walleye (the TRAA's
                    source for eggs).Interestingly, walleye 
                    (from egg through adult stages) continue 
                    to be transferred throughout Ontario wat-
                    erways and water bodies seemingly witho-

                            the walleye hatchery operations. The trailer

                            ottest days).

                            Here you can see all five bell jars loaded with walleye eggs.
                            Once the fry hatch, they naturally swim upward and aretaken away
                            by the clear tube, into the black drain to the outside circular growth tank. 
                            <br><br>
                            The fry were kept only for a short period of time in the growth tank as 
                            they became cannibalistic. After their short growth period they were
                            released into weedy, protected areas in Fanshawe Reservoir to begin their new lives.

                            This badly eroded section of Komoka Creek afforded
                            an opportunity to install a series of "lunker structures"
                            that create habitat for trout and other stream inhabitants.
                            Thesestructures will also combat further erosion at this
                            vulnerable site. Victor Fulcher, Jeremy Beaton and Paul 
                            Holmes check out the site. The stream actually flows under this 
                            structureabout as far back as where Paul is standing.

                            under these structures. The stick Randy's using is about a metre long!

                            structure. Native grasses and other plantswill have covered the area by
                            the spring of 2012 sothat the work that was done here will be 
                            indistinguishable from the surrounding streambanks.

                            The TRAA has been at this habitat improvement game
                            for a while and some of the structures have served
                            their purposes. Some of them actually need to be
                            removed or modified as the streamres ponds to the
                            changes. What remains of many of these structures
                            are the T-bars that were driven into the streambed
                            toanchor them in place. Most required 
                            a tow strap, a pry bar and a come-along to be pulled
                            from the streambed.It's tough work but they were all eventually removed.

                            Randy cuts a log to size for a deflector. A deflector is an
                            in-stream device that "steers" the stream's flow. This can
                            be useful in protecting vulnerable areas from erosion. Another
                            use is for speeding flow and creating depth. This does three
                            things: it improves oxygenation of the 
                            water, it stabilizes water temperatures at a cooler level
                            and it improves 
                            the stream's ability to carry silt.
